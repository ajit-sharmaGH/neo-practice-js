// 5. Write an ES6 function that takes two array of numbers of equal length and returns a new array with the sum of each corresponding element in the two arrays. Avoid using in-built methods.

export const sumArrays = () => {
    // Your ES6 code here


};

console.log(sumArrays([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 5])); // [2, 4, 6, 9]
